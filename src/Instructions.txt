- Main Objective: Control Pac-Man to eat all the small dots on the map to complete the level.

- Movement: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control Pac-Man's movement on the map.

- Running: Pac-Man moves continuously in the direction you choose until he encounters an obstacle (a wall) or changes direction.

- Small Dots (Dots): These are scattered throughout the map, and eating all the small dots completes the level.

- Behavior: The ghosts will move randomly around the map and chase Pacman when they detect him.

- Losing a Life: If a ghost touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. The game ends when Pac-Man runs out of lives.

- Ghost Speed: As time progresses and the levels continue, the ghosts move faster and become harder to avoid.

- Pac-Man is not only a challenge of reflexes and strategy but also a part of pop culture, famous for its simple yet addictive gameplay.
